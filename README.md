# walmart-app

Sample app that loads a list of contries into a RecyclerView. 

I used Hilt for dependency injection as its easier to setup than Dagger (and is built on top of Dagger anyway). 
For networking, I chose Retrofit as its pretty much the standard for network operations
I used Flow in my view models.

It should work in portrait and landscape mode
